Filtering Operators

Wireshark's filter syntax can be simple to understand making it easy to get a hold of quickly. To get the most out of these filters you need to have a basic understanding of boolean and logic operators.

Wireshark only has a few that you will need to be familiar with:

    and - operator: and / &&
    or - operator: or / ||
    equals - operator: eq / ==
    not equal - operator: ne / !=
    greater than - operator: gt /  >
    less than - operator: lt / <
